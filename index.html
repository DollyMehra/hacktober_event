When I approached Tim to help me develop a handbook for my private practice, he was all in and so excited to be part of the journey. His knowledge was vast, and he ensured my new business was built with up-to-date best practices and emerging standards. Tim made what can be mundane work very fun and challenged me to build a business with a strong mission statement, key characteristics, and critical actions. He helped me create strong job ads and will soon be training me in interviewing. I never understood the nuances of the hiring process until I began working with Tim!”</p>
